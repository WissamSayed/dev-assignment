# SR Dev Assignment

This is a small project that hopefully models the type of work you'll be doing at Stormrake. We'll give you time to explore and research, and then ask you to perform a few tasks.

## Use of AI
Co-pilot / Autocomplete is okay but no vibe coding please. i.e., please refrain from using AI-coded solutions.

## Approximate Timeframe
- **10 minutes**: Getting familiar with the code
- **15 minutes**: Attempting Task #1
- **15 minutes**: Attempting Task #2
- **15 minutes**: Open discussion

## Project Overview
This is a front-end, react app with mocked backend data. Initially, it shows transactions per account.

## How to run
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Tasks

### Task 1
Add a filter by `status` to the Transaction view.

### Task 2

Add a way to see a balance of each coin for an account. 

*Requirements*

* *Calculate* the balances from transactions. 
There is an `example-balances.json` for your reference, but this should not be used in code.

* Two types of balances will need to be accumulated.  
  * `available` balances are a cumulation of 'success' status transactions
  * `frozen` balances are a cumulation of 'pending' status transactions

* *Display* the balances for an account.

* Start with Design.  
Begin with designing potential solutions on a whiteboard or document. After discussion, move into code.

### Task 3
#### Open Discussion
What features or improvements would you suggest to make to the code, and how would you go about achieving these?
